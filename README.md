# ECU - Arduino Template for RC Car Development

Overview
The ECU (Electronic Control Unit) Template is an Arduino-based starting point for students developing their own control units for RC cars. This project simplifies the development process by providing a pre-configured setup with a working CAN (Controller Area Network) connection, allowing seamless communication between components of an RC car.
 
# Example Use Case
This template can be extended to control an RC car by managing:

<ul>
  <li>Throttle: Receive and interpret throttle commands via CAN.</li>
 <li>Steering: Adjust steering angles based on control input.</li>
 <li>Sensors: Read and transmit sensor data like speed or battery voltage.</li>
 <li>Communication: Exchange data with other ECUs or a central controller.</li>
</ul>
